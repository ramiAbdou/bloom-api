Christian,Ortiz,clo42@georgetown.edu,Georgetown University,Computer Science,2023,Hispanic/Latinx,Male,,"At Georgetown, there is currently relatively little focus on getting students into the tech industry and even less focus on students of color. As I saw that there were other minority based pre-professional groups on campus for business, pre-med, and pre-law, I thought that it would be great if I was able to provide the same concept but for those interested in tech. After speaking with Calvin Duran who started Latinos in Finance and Tech @ Harvard and Rainer Sainvil who was the co-president for URMC @ Cornell, I was inspired to start the Georgetown University Minorities in Tech Association. Currently, we are not offici0 recognized by the university as that process has been delayed until next semester, but my co-founder and I have already started working on programming, meetings, etc. The main 3 aspects that we are working on focusing are: Opportunities, Mentorship, and Education. As this is recruiting season, I feel that ColorStack might be able to facilitate the process of reaching out to recruiters to host events and providing learning resources in the next 3 months. I am happy that an organization like this exists, our communities desperately need this type of support. I look forward to hearing back from you.

 For example: 
 Prompt: 
 ""Jorge wants to know how long you expect centering a Div will take you""
 Sample response: 
 ""Hey Jorge! I believe centering a Div should take me 1 day, I'll keep the team posted if I encounter any issues!"" 
 
 Sample Implementation:
 Other users can then react with an emote signifying how well the response was or if certain tasks need to be worked on.
 
 Heart: response was clear, concise, not rude
 
 Books: Grammar needs improvement (perhaps this can be automated with Grammarly?)
 
 Smile: response has a professional tone
 
 I believe implementing a support system like that on slack would be great, I know there's a lot of possibilities with chat-bots and this is something I think can improve the productivity for many people who don't have English as their first language learned.

Ive read posts on reddit where the new hire doesnt feel like they belong at their company, that they were hired so for appearances, and sometimes that is the case. What I think would actu0 benefit the industry is evangelizing how technology and its fields to underrepresented groups from all over the globe. If we can motivate more of them to pursue a career in technology, the ethnic gap between what the standard we have now, and the new minority prospects that we want working in this field would shrink considerably. Ive always tried to get my friends to appreciate technology in more than just the consumer way. There are situations that they may be facing that can be solved by coming up with an application for it, and when I point out to them that theyre able to do it just by taking a few basic courses on sites like Udemy or Udacity, they get excited. We all should be pushing our friends to be curious and eager to learn, just like we should be doing that with minorities.",8/13/2020 3:11 PM,Family Member,Undergraduate,8/13/2020 3:11 PM

 The future belongs to the curious. Like Albert Einstein, I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious. Growing up in a traditional African household, curiosity was paramount. A shield to help protect me from some of the retrogressive African beliefs. My father even nicknamed me Curious Richard. My mother would always reiterate, Muchiri, curiosity killed the cat. To which I would always respond, And satisfaction brought it back. theless, I wasnt a cat. I didn't purr and I definitely never landed on my feet. And thus far my strong desire to learn hadnt killed me, it had only made me stronger. I believe the colorStack family will provide me with an ecosystem of like-minded individuals with a zeal and zest to succeed in the technology field. Individuals who will help me quest my curiosity. Individuals who will help me want to learn more and become a better version of myself. These individuals will make me push myself beyond beyond!
 I am a firm believer that no man is an island. Humans need others humans for continuous growth. The colorStack family will connect me to brilliant individuals with whom we shall make life long relationships with. 
 Unity is strength! By being part of a community that agitates for diversity in the tech space, I believe that I am part of a greater course to ensuring that no matter what skin color one is or what race one comes from, their will to succeed is far more important.

Coming back to the US for college from living in Peru, I have seen first-hand how various races/ethnicities are not properly represented in the tech workforce and its resulting implications. I hope to have the opportunity to be a part of a tight-knit group, centered on making tech equitable and accessible for people of all backgrounds. Having opportunities to network with diverse people of similar backgrounds within the same field is crucial to me, and I firmly believe ColorStack would find my perspective and contributions valuable.",6/15/2020 6:19 PM,Family Member,,6/15/2020 6:19 PM

Despite being interested in Computer Science, I often feel lost about the industry. Being a first-generation low-income student, with an educational background prior that barely exposed me to Computer Science, I have struggled on how to be active outside of class projects and clubs. I want to learn how to network for this particular industry and also learn how about resources (preferably free) that could assist me towards becoming a better programmer. Moreover, I would love to gain exposure to upcoming opportunities such as hackathons, internships, etc, that would allow me to push myself to grow as a coder. A mentor, preferably a women in stem, would be immensely helpful, as she would be able to guide me through dealing with imposter syndrome both within the classroom, but also in the overall field.",6/14/2020 9:52 PM,Family Member,,6/14/2020 9:52 PM
